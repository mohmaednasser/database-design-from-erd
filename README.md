🗄️ From ERD to Database Tables | Database Design Project

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete process of designing a relational database
starting from an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and transforming it into
well-structured and normalized database tables ready for implementation.

The project focuses on understanding business requirements,
modeling entities and relationships, and converting them into a logical database schema.

---

🎯 Project Objectives
- Design clear and accurate ERDs based on business requirements
- Identify entities, attributes, and relationships
- Apply normalization principles
- Convert ERD structures into relational database tables
- Prepare the database design for SQL implementation

---

🧩 ERD Design
The ERDs illustrate:
- Core entities and their attributes
- One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
- Associative (junction) tables for M:N relationships
- Primary keys and foreign keys

🔹 Sample ERD Diagrams

🗂 Database Tables Design
Based on the ERDs, the following database tables were designed:

🔹 Core Tables
- Student
- Course
- Group
- Instructor
- Session
- Payment

🔹 Junction Tables
- Student_Group
- Student_Session

These tables ensure data integrity and proper relationship handling.
